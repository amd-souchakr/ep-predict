# Experiment log

Keep one short entry per meaningful run. Do not log routine command retries.
The immutable run manifest and metrics remain the source of truth.

## Runs

### `h1-standard-small-dataset` — 2026-07-31

- Hypothesis: H1 preparation.
- Question: Can a small balanced standard workload be materialized reproducibly?
- Config: `configs/dataset/h1-standard-small.toml`.
- Artifact: `artifacts/datasets/h1-standard-small/manifest.json`.
- Result: 128 unique prompts, 32 each from WikiText-2, GSM8K, HumanEval,
  and MT-Bench; SHA-256
  `4e08d5b4753ed1d06e6922359ea63249d4e4d215c9bc5081204533adf369fcf1`.
- Integrity checks: pinned revisions, balanced domains, source-code whitespace
  retained, answers/solutions excluded.
- Decision: use this for H1; retain authored prompts only as a hook smoke test.
- One next action: collect a two-request OLMoE trace on the CUDA host.
